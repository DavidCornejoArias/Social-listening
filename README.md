# Social-listening

This small project takes out some specific type of tweets where someone is mention. 
I was asked to develop this to understand people's opinion about the competition of the bank that I worked for. 
This is particularly difficult to do, since there's not direct method in Twitter API. 
This is the first part of the project, I changed it to extract tweets where Princeton account is mentioned.
